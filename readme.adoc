== What

Small react project to remind myself how to hook up various things.

.A webpack build incorporating loaders for
* less
* jsx
* fonts
* templated html source

.A Karma testing setup that uses
* webpack
* jasmine
* rewire

.Semantic-ui
* key thing is using it from an npm package and getting the fonts processed into the bundle

== Resources

I cobbled this together as a starting point for a new side project for learning React.  The main short term goal is just to have all the development pieces in place to go forward with some coding.  The surfing safari that got me to this point had lots of interesting stops, among them:

http://substantial.com/blog/2014/11/11/test-driven-react-how-to-manually-mock-components/[Mars Hall's blog].  From here the main thing is the use of a webpack plugin and a mocking strategy that's almost as simple as using Jest.

http://myshareoftech.com/2013/12/unit-testing-react-dot-js-with-jasmine-and-karma.html[Oleaksandr Rudenko's blog] and of course https://github.com/webpack/karma-webpack[the karma-webpack repository] were both helpful for organizing the test execution setup.

https://github.com/jhudson8/react-semantic-ui/tree/master/docs[react-sematic-ui] and http://semantic-ui.com/[The Semantic-ui website].

== Problems

The two simple test files are basically the same tests, one mocks a child component, the other doesn't.  I made them to try and understand what the whole rewire approach was really doing, and to get a start on learning how to test React components.

The rewire approach results in the React warning

`WARN: 'Warning: This JSX uses a plain function. Only React components are valid in React's JSX transform.'`

I tried several different ways of expressing the operations, but none silenced the warning.  I'd especially like to have a working example that doesn't have this problem.  If you have one, please send me a link so I can fix it here.

== Not Done

There are things I'll likely add to this over time.  Like expanding it to show how to test React apps when using https://github.com/rackt/react-router[react-router] and https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs[reflux].

Semantic-ui is very interesting.  It would be nice to have a demo of incorporating customizations, like themes, in the build.

Pull requests that keep things simple but demonstrate good ways to use these tools together are welcome.
